Carbonteq dev portal is an ever-evolving platform initially designed to bridge the gap between academia and industry. But from few training exercises it has evolved and became much more.

Here we share industry best practices and principles to design and develop next generation software. Furthermore, we have gathered some small and concise projects to further stimulate the curiosity of undergrads and industry professional alike.

Exercises are meant for developers who have already covered the basis and associated frameworks related to their career progression and are now planning to hone their skill for building realworld production apps. It's a task based system where you are assigned a mentor inside [carbonteq](https://carbonteq.com/) who reviews your code to evaluate code quality and observance of best practices and principals.
